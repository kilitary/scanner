END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

VERY IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, either for yourself individually or on behalf of the entity that licensed the software, as applicable, "you" or "your", and /N SOFTWARE INC. ("/N SOFTWARE"). Please read the terms and conditions of this agreement carefully before accepting this agreement. By clicking on the "I Agree" button below, you are agreeing to be bound by this agreement for yourself individually and on behalf of the entity that licensed the software and representing that you are authorized to do so.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the effective date of this Agreement shall be the date upon which you click the "I Agree" button below. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this agreement, click the "Cancel" button and the installation process will cease.  The order for the licensed software may not be cancelled once you have clicked the "I Agree" button. This is a license and not a sale. This Agreement does not operate as an acceptance of any conflicting terms and conditions and shall prevail over any conflicting provisions of any purchase order or any other instruments.  If you have signed a written software license agreement with /N SOFTWARE covering the use of the Licensed Software, the terms of the signed license agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms of this Agreement. You, at your own expense, shall be responsible for installing the Licensed Software and all Updates.
